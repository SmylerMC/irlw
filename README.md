### What is it?
A Minecraft mod adding a new "IRL" world type which uses real world data from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)'s API to generate Minecraft worlds. The mod is still in very early development, and has a lot of issues to fix, but is somewhat functional: it is capable of fetching height data and can generate worlds of different sizes. The final goal of the mod is to provide a fully working  world generator, capable of generating various types of worlds, from survival frendly to as realistic as possible.
